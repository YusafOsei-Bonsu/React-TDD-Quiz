## Blockers/Resolutions

### Deploying React Quiz to Heroku

We struggled to deploy the React Quiz onto the Heroku Cloud Platform. Fortunately, we have discovered a way to do so.
  1. We created an Express app (`server.js`) file (in the root directory) which serves a single route...
      ```javascript
      const express = require('express');
      // eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars
      const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
      const path = require('path');
      const app = express();
      const port = process.env.PORT || 8080;
      app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "build")));

      This route serves the react app`
      `app.get('/', (req, res) => res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, "build", "index.html")));

      app.listen(port, () => console.log(``Server listening on port ${port}``));
      ```

      - Optionally, you can test if the server runs the React application by entering `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js` in the terminal.

  2. In `package.json`, we wrote the following properties...
     - `"engines": { "npm": "6.14.1", "node": "12.13.0" }`.
     - `"main": "server.js"`.
     - In the `Scripts` object, we added the following property: `"heroku-postbuild": "npm install"` and set the `start` script to `"node server.js"`.

  3. Created a file called `Procfile` (in the root directory) with one line: `web: node server.js`.

  4. Entered `npm run build` in the terminal and removed `/build` from `.gitignore` by commenting it out.

  5. Committed steps 1-4 to GitHub and Heroku repository.
